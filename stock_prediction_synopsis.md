## 1. Abstract
This synopsis outlines a machine learning project to predict stock prices and returns with the goal of delivering short-term forecasts and risk-aware signals for decision support. The approach combines time-series modeling, feature engineering, and deep learning architectures while integrating public market data and alternative data sources into a unified, reproducible pipeline. Models are compared across multiple horizons (e.g., next day, next week, next month), and evaluation emphasizes economic utility rather than only statistical accuracy. The system targets latency awareness and robustness to regime shifts, and key contributions include a modular pipeline and a disciplined backtesting framework. Ethical and compliance safeguards are embedded to mitigate misuse and bias, and the expected outcome is a deployable, well-tested forecasting and signaling system.

## 2. Introduction
Financial markets exhibit nonstationarity, noise, and structural breaks that challenge conventional forecasting methods. Classical linear models often struggle under regime changes and heavy-tailed distributions, whereas recent advances in representation learning enable richer temporal modeling. However, overfitting and backtest over-optimization remain common pitfalls that can inflate in-sample performance and degrade real-world utility. This project addresses these challenges through careful system design, time-aware validation, and robust evaluation. The scope focuses on equities, with extensions to ETFs and indices noted, and covers both point forecasts and direction classification alongside uncertainty estimates to inform position sizing. The system is designed for research-first iteration with a clear path to production hardening, maintaining strict reproducibility, data lineage, and separation of data, model, and evaluation layers, with success measured by predictive as well as economic performance.

## 3. Literature Review
Time-series econometrics such as ARIMA and GARCH families model autocorrelation and conditional volatility, while factor models like Fama–French explain cross-sectional returns via systematic risk factors. Machine learning methods, including Random Forests and XGBoost, capture nonlinear interactions in tabular features, and sequence models like LSTM and GRU handle long-term dependencies in price dynamics. Temporal Convolutional Networks provide parallelizable sequence modeling, and Transformers enable attention over long horizons with adaptive context windows. Hybrid strategies blend statistical baselines with deep residual learners, and regime-switching models account for state-dependent market dynamics. Methodological safeguards such as meta-labeling, purged k-fold cross-validation, and embargo reduce look-ahead bias and leakage, while walk-forward analysis simulates live rebalancing under drift. Economic backtesting brings realism through costs, slippage, and constraints, aligning model assessment with practical trading outcomes.

## 4. Dataset and Preprocessing
Core market data consists of OHLCV bars at daily and minute resolutions, adjusted for corporate actions to preserve price continuity. Fundamental and alternative datasets are aligned on a trading calendar to ensure temporal consistency and are joined to create a comprehensive feature space. Feature engineering spans technical indicators, volatility and momentum measures, seasonality effects, and market microstructure signals derived from intraday imbalance and spreads. Targets include returns, log-returns, and directional labels, with labeling windows defined by prediction horizons and overlap handling. Missing values are imputed via forward filling and model-based methods, outliers are winsorized using robust statistics, and all transformations are fit exclusively on training data to prevent leakage. Time-aware partitioning with embargo periods is applied, and metadata captures data provenance, versioning, and quality checks.

## 5. Methodology
The system implements a modular pipeline that orchestrates data ingest, feature generation, model training, and evaluation under a configuration-driven workflow. Baselines include naive last-value, moving average, and ARIMA variants, while strong tabular baselines such as Random Forest and XGBoost benchmark nonlinear performance. Sequence models span LSTM, GRU, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and Transformer encoders, and a mixed-frequency architecture fuses daily and intraday representations for richer context. Feature selection relies on mutual information and permutation importance, with regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping to curb overfitting. Hyperparameters are tuned via Bayesian optimization using time-aware cross-validation; losses include MSE and Huber for regression and focal loss for classification. Uncertainty is estimated through Monte Carlo dropout and quantile regression, and ensembles blend diverse learners via stacking and model averaging. Risk overlays translate predictions into position sizes under exposure limits and turnover constraints, and the codebase emphasizes type safety, testing, and reproducible experiments tracked with versioned configs and artifact logging.

## 6. Experiments and Evaluation
Experiments follow a rolling walk-forward protocol that defines train, validation, and test windows over time to approximate live trading. Statistical metrics include RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and directional accuracy, while economic metrics such as Sharpe, Sortino, and maximum drawdown assess practical viability. Turnover and capacity constraints are reported to account for execution realism, and transaction costs and slippage are modeled conservatively. Ablation studies isolate the contribution of feature groups and model components, robustness checks probe sensitivity to lookbacks and window sizes, and stress tests simulate crisis periods and illiquidity. Calibration curves evaluate probabilistic reliability, and statistical significance is established via bootstrapped confidence intervals. Backtest hygiene enforces purging, embargo, and disciplined parameter handling, with reproducibility ensured through fixed seeds, deterministic operations where feasible, and manifest-based artifact tracking.

## 7. Results and Discussion
Baselines establish a realistic performance yardstick, against which ensembles of diverse learners consistently outperform single models. Transformers tend to excel on longer horizons where rich cross-feature context matters, while LSTMs and TCNs perform strongly in short-term regimes with heightened volatility. Feature sets emphasizing volatility and microstructure improve directional classification, and economic performance remains robust after accounting for transaction costs and constraints. Risk-aware position sizing improves drawdown profiles and stabilizes equity curves, and sensitivity analyses indicate that performance is relatively stable across reasonable hyperparameter ranges. Regime analysis reveals heterogeneous performance across market states, and error analysis highlights challenges around earnings windows and event-driven weeks. Remaining limitations include data snooping risks and survivorship biases, and successful deployment requires ongoing monitoring, model governance, and fail-safe mechanisms.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
This project delivers a disciplined, reproducible pipeline for stock return forecasting that balances modeling power with validation hygiene. Results indicate economically meaningful improvements over baselines, demonstrating value from ensembling and modern sequence architectures under realistic backtesting. Future work includes expanding to cross-sectional and multi-asset transfer learning, along with integrating causal signals and event embeddings for improved interpretability. Live paper trading and monitoring will validate real-time robustness, while continuous evaluation and periodic retraining will combat regime drift. Ethical and compliance guardrails remain integral to deployment, ensuring responsible use and sustained alignment with risk and governance requirements.
